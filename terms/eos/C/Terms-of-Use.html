<h1 class="title">Endless Terms of Use</h1>
<p class="date"><p>Last Updated: 25 April 2022</p></p>
</header>
<p>Thank you for your selection of an Endless OS Foundation LLC
(“<strong>Endless</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>,” or
“<strong>us</strong>”) product. Endless was created to inspire and to
empower, and so we strive to appreciate and respect our users.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use (the “<strong>Terms</strong>”) are a legally
binding contract between you and Endless regarding your use of the
Software and Services. The Terms will govern your use of the Endless
operating system (the “<strong>OS</strong>”), the Endless and
third-party programs included with or made available for the OS (the
“<strong>Apps</strong>”), and other services provided by us such as
online communications, identity, and distribution of additional
materials, Apps and Updates (the <strong>“Services</strong>”).</p>
<p class="highlight">
Please read these Terms carefully. By clicking “accept” you acknowledge
that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by the Terms.
</p>
<p>If you do not agree to these Terms, then please do not use the
Software or the Services. If you acquired a device with the Software
pre-loaded and do not agree to these Terms, you should return the device
(including all accessories and materials provided with it) to the
retailer where you purchased it and request a refund of the purchase
price.</p>
<p class="highlight">
These Terms include an arbitration agreement, by which you agree that
binding arbitration will resolve all disputes between you and Endless.
Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge; and
your claims cannot be brought as a class action. Please review Section
15. below for further details.
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>License to Endless Software and Updates.</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Software</strong>. Unless specifically noted otherwise in
writing, the OS, Apps, Updates (as defined below), and other materials
distributed to you in connection with the Services (together, the
“<strong>Software</strong>”) are licensed and are not sold. All Software
is provided to you subject to a limited, individual, revocable,
non-exclusive, non-transferrable, and non-assignable personal license to
use the Software, subject to your compliance with these Terms. Endless
reserves all rights to the Software not granted expressly in these
Terms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Updates</strong>. From time to time, Endless may, at its
own discretion, create updates, upgrades, enhancements or bug fixes
(collectively “<strong>Updates</strong>”) to the Software, and make such
Updates available to you. The Software may automatically download and
install Updates without user confirmation, and Updates may modify or
remove certain functionality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Copying and Distribution</strong>. You may copy and
distribute the Software as described by any of the following
clauses.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Personal &amp; Non-Commercial Use</strong>: We encourage
you to download and install the Software for personal use, or in
non-commercial settings such as public, educational or non-profit
institutions. You are permitted to install the Software on one or more
devices for these purposes. Such installations must be made using
installation methods outlined in our documentation; except as set out
within the Terms, modifications to the Software are not
permitted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Physical Redistribution</strong>: You may redistribute
pristine, unmodified copies of the Software on physical media such as
CD/DVD, USB disk or SD/MMC card. If you wish, you may charge a nominal
fee to the end user to defray your costs related to the media. No
commercial agreement with Endless is needed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Online Redistribution</strong>: You may redistribute
pristine, unmodified copies of the Software online by becoming a public
mirror or by utilizing our BitTorrent tracker.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Eligibility</strong>. You represent and warrant to us
that you are legally able to contract with us, or that if you are under
age, a legal guardian, tutor or parent has agreed to the terms. If you
are using the Software or Services on behalf of an entity, organization,
or company, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to
bind that entity, organization, or company to these Terms and you agree
to be bound by these Terms on behalf of that entity, organization, or
company.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong>. When using the Software or
Services you may be exposed to content from a variety of third party
sources, including the internet. You acknowledge that such content may
be inaccurate, offensive, indecent or objectionable, and you waive any
legal or equitable rights or remedies you may have against Endless with
respect to such content.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Collection.</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Default.</strong> Certain information is reported to
Endless periodically by the Software. This information includes the
version of the OS which was installed and is currently being used, the
device that is being used to run the OS and its approximate location,
how the OS was installed, and how long the OS has been installed on that
device.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Optional.</strong> Additional information may be reported
to Endless periodically by the Software’s user metrics system. To enable
and disable this system, use the “Privacy” settings in the OS control
center.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Usage.</strong> Endless may process and use the data
it collects about your usage (collectively, the Usage Information), and
may share the Usage Information in an anonymous and aggregate form with
third parties including, but not limited to, current and potential
content providers, app developers and, in the specific case of the
devices involved in their deployments, partners who are deploying the
Software in educational or other charitable settings. In addition, when
legally required, Usage Information may be shared with government
agencies.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Prohibited Conduct</strong>. You will not:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>use the Software or Services for any fraudulent or illegal
purpose, or in violation of any local, state, national, or international
law;</p></li>
<li><p>violate the rights of third parties, including by infringing or
misappropriating third-party intellectual property rights;</p></li>
<li><p>attempt to do any of the foregoing in this Section 5., or assist
or permit any persons in engaging or attempting to engage in any of the
activities described in this Section 5..</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Termination of Use; Discontinuation and Modification of
the Service</strong>. If you violate any provision of these Terms, your
permission to use the Software and Services will terminate
automatically. You may terminate these Terms at any time by contacting
us at <a href="mailto:legal@endlessos.org">legal@endlessos.org</a>. If
you terminate these Terms, you will remain obligated to pay all
outstanding fees, if any, relating to your use of the Software or
Services incurred prior to termination. Upon termination of these Terms,
you will cease all use of the Software and Services. Additionally,
Endless, in its sole discretion may suspend or terminate your access to
the Services at any time, with or without notice. We also reserve the
right to modify or discontinue providing the Services at any time
(including, without limitation, by limiting or discontinuing certain
features of the Services) without notice to you.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Additional Terms</strong>. Your use of the Software and
Services is subject to any and all additional terms, policies, rules, or
guidelines applicable to the Software and Services or certain features
we may provide now or in the future (the “<strong>Additional
Terms</strong>”), such as end-user license agreements for any Apps that
we may offer, or rules applicable to particular features or content on
the Services, subject to Section 9. below. The Additional Terms may
require you to agree to them from time to time in order to continue use
of the Software and Services. All such Additional Terms are hereby
incorporated by reference into, and made a part of, these
Terms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Languages and Localization</strong>. In the event of a
dispute between the English version of these terms and any translated
versions, the <a
href="../../../../../../../../usr/share/eos-license-service/terms/eos/C/Terms-of-Use.pdf">English</a>
version will govern, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law. The
Software and Services, including Third Party Software, may not be
available in all languages or in all countries, and Endless makes no
representation that the Software and Services are appropriate or
available for use in any particular location.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Third Party Software and Open Source</strong>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Third Party Terms</strong>. The Software contains
materials, including software code, provided by third parties
(“<strong>Third Party Software</strong>”) subject to separate license
terms (the “<strong>Third Party Terms</strong>”). Endless has no
obligation to provide updates, maintenance, warranty, technical or other
support or services for Third Party Software or third-party services.
Your use of the Third Party Software in conjunction with the Software in
a manner consistent with the Terms is permitted. You may have broader
rights under the applicable Third Party Terms and nothing in the Terms
is intended to impose further restrictions on your use of the Third
Party Software. In addition to Sections 9.3. and 9.4. below, you can
find certain required notices and other information regarding Third
Party Software, including open source software, <a
href="http://localhost:3010/">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Source Modification</strong>. Endless makes
available some of the open source components included in the Third Party
Software on our public GitHub account, located at <a
href="https://github.com/endlessm"
class="uri">https://github.com/endlessm</a>. Endless does not represent
or warrant that the licensing information provided is correct or
error-free, and we encourage you to notify us of any inaccurate
information. If you make modifications to any open source software
contained in the Software, Endless updates may overwrite such
modifications without warning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Google</strong>. Use of Google Inc.’s software and
services in the Software is subject to the Google terms of service (<a
href="http://www.google.com/terms_of_service.html"
class="uri">http://www.google.com/terms_of_service.html</a>) and to
Google’s privacy policy (<a
href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html"
class="uri">http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html</a>).</p></li>

the Software is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License (GPL) or the GNU Library/Lesser General Public License (LGPL).
The GPL/LGPL software is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and
expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of

our defense of such claim.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disclaimers; No Warranties</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight">
<p>The Software, Services and any device hardware, and all materials and
content available through the Software and Services, are provided “as
is” and on an “as available” basis, without warranty or condition of any
kind, whether express, implied, or statutory. The Endless Entities
specifically (but without limitation) disclaim all warranties of any
kind, whether express or implied, relating to the Software and Services
and all materials and content available through the Software and
Services, including but not limited to: (a) any implied warranties of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, satisfactory
quality, accuracy, performance, quiet enjoyment, or non-infringement;
and (b) any warranties arising out of course of dealing, usage, or
trade. The Endless Entities do not warrant against interference with
your enjoyment of the Software or Services, that the functions contained
in or services performed or provided by Endless will meet your
requirements or expectations, that any services will continue to be made
available, that the Software or Services will be compatible or work with
any third-party software, applications, or third-party services, that
the Software or Services or any part thereof will be uninterrupted,
secure, or free of errors, defects, viruses, or other harmful
components, or that any of the foregoing will be corrected. Endless does
not warrant or represent that the Software will be compatible with any
operating systems, applications, or hardware provided by third parties.
Installation or use of the Software may affect the usability of
third-party software, applications, or third-party services.</p>
<p>You assume all risk for all damages that may result from your use of
or access to the Services, your dealings with other Services users, and
any materials or content available through the Services. You understand
and agree that you use the Services and use, access, download, or
otherwise obtain materials or content through the Services and any
associated sites or services at your own discretion and risk, and you
will be solely responsible for any damage to your property (including
your computer system used in connection with the service) or loss of
data that results from the use of the Service or the download or use of
such materials or content.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that the Software and Services are not intended or
suitable for use in situations or environments where the failure or time
delays of, or errors or inaccuracies in the content, data, or
information provided by the software or service could lead to death,
personal injury, fire or severe physical or environmental damage,
including without limitations the operation of nuclear facilities,
aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control, motor
vehicles, life support, or weapons systems.</p>
<p>No oral or written information or advice provided by Endless or its
authorized representatives will create any warranties not expressly set
forth in these terms. If the Software or Services prove defective and
thereby incur any damage, you assume the entire cost of all necessary
servicing, repair, or correction.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions may prohibit some disclaimers of warranties and
you may have other rights that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
To find about more about your rights, you should contact a local
consumer organization, consumer protection authority, or attorney.</p>
</div>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong></li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight">
<p>In no event will the Endless Entities be liable to you for any
indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages
(including, without limitation, damages due to business interruption,
moral damages, loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, including
corruption of data or failure to transmit or receive any data or
information, or other intangible losses) arising out of or relating to
your access to or use of, your inability to access or use, or changes
to, the Software or Services or any materials or content on the Software
or Services, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including
negligence), statute or any other legal theory, whether or not the
Endless Entities have been informed of the possibility of such
damage.</p>
<p>You agree that the aggregate liability of the Endless Entities to you
for any and all claims arising out of or relating to the use of or any
inability to use the service (including any materials or content
available through the service, temporarily or permanently) or otherwise
under these terms, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, is limited
to $50 United States Dollars or the amount you paid for the Service,
whichever is smaller.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
liability for consequential or incidental damages. Accordingly, if that
is the case, and only to that extent, the above limitation may not apply
to you.</p>
<p>Each provision of these terms that provides for a limitation of
liability, disclaimer of warranties, or exclusion of damages is agreed
to allocate the risks under these terms between the parties. This
allocation is an essential element of the basis of the bargain between
the parties. Each of these provisions is severable and independent of
all other provisions of these terms. The limitations in this section 12.
will apply even if any limited remedy fails of its essential
purpose.</p>
</div>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Export</strong>. Endless’s Software and Services may be
subject to domestic and foreign export and reexport control laws and
regulations. You will comply with all applicable export and reexport
control laws and regulations, including both domestic and foreign
controls. Specifically, you warrant that you are: (a) not located in
Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria; and (b) not a denied party as
specified in domestic or foreign regulations. You will not, directly or
indirectly, sell, export, reexport, transfer, divert, or otherwise
dispose of any products, software, or technology (including products
derived from or based on such technology) received from Endless to any
destination, entity, or person prohibited by applicable laws or
regulations, including those of any other country from which the product
has been exported, without obtaining prior authorization from the
competent government authorities as required by those laws and
regulations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>General.</strong> These Terms, together with any other
agreements expressly incorporated by reference herein, constitute the
entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Endless
regarding your use of and access to the Software and Services. You may
not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights hereunder, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written
consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice. The
failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our
right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver
of any breach or default of these Terms or any provision of these Terms
constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of
the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for
convenience only and shall not have any impact on the interpretation of
particular provisions. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid
or unenforceable, the unenforceable part shall be given effect to the
greatest extent possible and the remaining parts will remain in full
force and effect. Upon termination of these Terms Sections 2.-3. and
5.-17. will survive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Generally.</strong> <span class="highlight">This contract
contains an arbitration agreement. In the interest of resolving disputes
between you and Endless in the most expedient and cost effective manner,
you and Endless agree that any and all disputes arising in connection
with these Terms shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration
is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral
arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited
discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by
courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court
can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not
limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these
Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether
the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms. You
understand and agree that, by entering into these terms, you and Endless
are each waiving the right to a trial or to participate in a class
action.</span></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exceptions</strong>. Notwithstanding subsection 15.1.,
nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit
either of our right to: (a) pursue enforcement actions through
applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are
available; and (b) seek injunctive relief, to the extent permitted by
law or in connection with the arbitration, in a court of law.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Arbitrator</strong>. Any arbitration between you and
Endless will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures
and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes
(collectively, “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”) of the American Arbitration
Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”), as modified by these Terms, and
will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are
available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879,
or by contacting Endless.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Notice; Process</strong>. A party who intends to seek
arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the
other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or if
we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail
(“<strong>Notice</strong>”). Endless’s address for Notice is: Endless OS
Foundation LLC, 24A Trolley Square # 2319, Wilmington, DE 19806, USA.
The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or
dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought
(“<strong>Demand</strong>”). We agree to use good faith efforts to
resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so
within 30 calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Endless may
commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount
of any settlement offer made by you or Endless shall not be disclosed to
the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and

more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any
form of a representative or class proceeding.</span></p></li>
